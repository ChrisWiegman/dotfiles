# My dotfiles

This repo is a bit more than dotfiles. It includes those, of course, as well as scripts allowing me to setup (or reset) any of my machines very quickly.

Note this is an evolving repo and tends to represent where my machines are on any given day. My motivation is that it allows me to rebuild a machine I own in 2 hours or less, something I've found can be very handy over the years. Use it at your own risk.

## Layout

- **apps** Configs for the various apps I use
- **machines** dotfiles and setup scripts that are applicable per machine
- **shared** dotfiles and setup scripts that I can use on any machine

## Usage

```
git clone git://github.com/ChrisWiegman/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh [mac|linux|work]
```
